# Fourier-Latent Differential Evolution Optimizer

This repository contains the implementation of a **Fourier-based dimensionality reduction framework** for high-dimensional optimization using **Differential Evolution (DE)** in latent space.  
It accompanies the preprint:

**"Latent-Space Genetic Algorithms for High-Dimensional Optimization via Random Projection, SVD, and Fourier Transform"**

## üîç Overview

Traditional metaheuristics like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) suffer in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality.  
In this work, we project the original 5000D space into a **1D latent space** using **Fourier Transform (FFT/IFT)**, and run DE in this compressed domain.

Despite extreme compression, the optimizer consistently reaches **global optima** for benchmark functions like Sphere, Rastrigin, Ackley, Zakharov, etc.
